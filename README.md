# Text-Classification

Various tasks achieved in this project include:

1. Performed Test Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes(already implemented in sklearn).
2. Implemented Naive Bayes on my own from scratch for text classification. 
3. Compared the Results of self implementation of Naive Bayes with one in Sklearn.

Dataset Used: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups

The dataset had documents (articles/messages) for 20 News Groups.
For each News Groups there were about 1000 documents.
Firstly, the input data was converted from the Text format to the usable Table format.
Then the data was used for training and testing purposes.
